Ecocity was started by myself in 1996.  I have struggled to realize the fullness of the vision that unfolded quickly on front of my eyes on that stool in the ranch home I had rented the summer of 1996.  So much life has been lived since then.

I bring the passion of this life well lived to the job now of seeking out actionable areas of society as it strives to shift.  

HOW DOES IT SHIFT?

that's up to us.  What we do and how we see one another. Please join me in this effort to set precedent with simple, humble acts.  We have only the moment of now to act within, yet future people and the health of our planet hangs on the choices we make now.   Lets make good choices together, and talk about them.  Life is not a meaningless pursuit.
