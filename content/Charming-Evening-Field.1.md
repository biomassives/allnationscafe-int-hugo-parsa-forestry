Simple actions make a big difference.  Ecocity spring wildlife advocacy campaign is currently active in Canton, New York, Saint Lawrence County, where hibernating turtles are waking up and crossing roads.  Please post to the hashtag #tutlecrossings with photos of an turtles you may see crossing the road. 

We have just relaunched Ecocity.com today, with this campaign and have the goal to provide rewards for 'Ecocity pioneers' who take action on behalf of the local environment.  In your own home, please work together to keep track of the number of turtle lives you save from being run over.  Simply moving them off the road toward their destination does wonders for your turtle karma.  Good luck, and thank you for caring.
