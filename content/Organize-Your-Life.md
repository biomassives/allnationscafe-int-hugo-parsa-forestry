Water is a human right and SDG #6.

[https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/human_right_to_water_and_sanitation_media_brief.pdf](https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/human_right_to_water_and_sanitation_media_brief.pdf "https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/human_right_to_water_and_sanitation_media_brief.pdf")

Water has become a critical commodity.  There is some concern about what the implications are of water futures now being listed on the US commodity futures market.   

STATUS QUO

Borehole drilling remains a common request for engineers.  Accordingly, many engineering firms will provide support for a borehole project.   A borehole well for water may not be the best solution - or at least on its own. 

WATERSHED PLANNING

Water comes from clouds that refill surface water sources and recharge aquifers.  Clouds do not form if forest cover has been cut out for charcoal, timber, cropland, mining, etc.  From an international context, carbon trading credits are one pathway.  Providing relief from the common pressures causing the destruction of forests is the goal.  An effective path involved addressing the climate crisis while simultaneously addressing long term water security. 

When we tie together the need for jobs and economic prosperity with climate stabilization, we step into a longer term planning paradigm.
